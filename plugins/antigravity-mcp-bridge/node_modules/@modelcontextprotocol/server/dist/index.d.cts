 * `ctx.mcpReq.requestState<T>()` accessor — the seam has already run `verify`
 * (integrity proven, payload decoded) by the time the handler is entered.
 *
 * Verification is fail-closed and constant-time (WebCrypto `subtle.verify` for

 * HKDF-SHA256, with an auto-generated per-process ephemeral key when none is
 * supplied. This codec deliberately ships only the signed mode and a single
 * keyed HMAC (domain-separated by input prefix) — HKDF sub-key derivation and
 * an encrypted mode are intentionally out of scope for the initial release.

 * This transport works on any runtime that supports Web Standards: Node.js 18+, Cloudflare Workers, Deno, Bun, etc.
 *
 * In stateful mode:
 * - Session ID is generated and included in response headers
 * - Session ID is always included in initialization responses
 * - Requests with invalid session IDs are rejected with `404 Not Found`
 * - Non-initialization requests without a session ID are rejected with `400 Bad Request`
 * - State is maintained in-memory (connections, message history)
 *
 * In stateless mode:
 * - No Session ID is included in any responses
 * - No session validation is performed
 *
 * @example Stateful setup
 * ```ts source="./streamableHttp.examples.ts#WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport_stateful"
 * const server = new McpServer({ name: 'my-server', version: '1.0.0' });
 *
 * const transport = new WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport({
 *     sessionIdGenerator: () => crypto.randomUUID()
 * });
 *
 * await server.connect(transport);
 * ```
 *
 * @example Stateless setup
 * ```ts source="./streamableHttp.examples.ts#WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport_stateless"
 * const transport = new WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport({
 *     sessionIdGenerator: undefined
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example Hono.js
 * ```ts source="./streamableHttp.examples.ts#WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport_hono"
 * app.all('/mcp', async c => {
 *     // Stateless example: create a server and a transport per request.
 *     const server = new McpServer({ name: 'my-server', version: '1.0.0' });
 *     const transport = new WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport({ sessionIdGenerator: undefined });
 *     await server.connect(transport);
